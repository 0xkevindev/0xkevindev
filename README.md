I'm Kevin, a computer science student.  
I enjoy building side projects, I use arch btw :D, and tweaking my system setup just for fun.

Mostly into backend development, system customization, and learning new tools.  
You'll usually find me coding late at night, breaking things, and figuring out how they work.

Always experimenting. Always learning.
